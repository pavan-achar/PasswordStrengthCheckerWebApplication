# PasswordStrengthCheckerWebApplication
A modern, responsive **Password Strength Checker** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It analyzes passwords for entropy, detects weak patterns, and gives actionable suggestions to help users create strong and secure passwords.

## 🚀 Features  

✅ Real-time password strength evaluation  
✅ Entropy-based scoring (0–100)  
✅ Detects:  
- Common & leaked passwords  
- Sequential patterns (e.g., `abcd`, `1234`)  
- Repeated characters (`aaaa`, `1111`)  
✅ Suggestions to improve password security  
✅ Color-coded strength meter  
✅ Password generator (random strong password)  
✅ Copy to clipboard  
✅ Fully responsive UI (works on mobile & desktop)  
✅ 100% client-side — no backend or data collection

## ⚙️ How to Run  

### Option 1 – Local setup  
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pavan-achar/password-strength-checker.git
   cd password-strength-checker
````

2. Open the file in your browser:

   ```bash
   open index.html        # macOS
   # or
   start index.html       # Windows
   ```

That’s it! The app runs fully offline.

### Option 2 – Deploy Online

You can deploy easily on:

* **GitHub Pages** (just enable it under Repo → Settings → Pages)
* **Netlify**, **Vercel**, or **Firebase Hosting** — drag and drop your `index.html`

## 🧮 Password Scoring Logic

The strength score is calculated using:

* **Entropy formula:** `entropy = length * log2(pool_size)`
* Penalizes weak characteristics:

  * Common passwords (e.g., `password`, `123456`)
  * Repeated or sequential characters
  * Short passwords (< 8 chars)
* Rewards:

  * Longer passwords
  * Mixed character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols)
* Strength levels:

  | Rating    | Score | Entropy Range |
  | --------- | ----- | ------------- |
  | Very Weak | <30   | <25 bits      |
  | Weak      | 30–49 | 25–35 bits    |
  | Moderate  | 50–69 | 36–49 bits    |
  | Strong    | 70–84 | 50–59 bits    |
  | Excellent | ≥85   | 60+ bits      |

## 🧰 Example Output

| Password           | Entropy   | Score | Rating    | Suggestions               |
| ------------------ | --------- | ----- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| `password123`      | 32.8 bits | 38    | Weak      | Avoid common passwords    |
| `Pa$$word2024`     | 45.6 bits | 64    | Moderate  | Add more length & symbols |
| `sTr0ng!Pass2024$` | 67.3 bits | 88    | Excellent | ✅ No improvements needed  |

## 🧩 Future Improvements

* [ ] Integrate **zxcvbn.js** for advanced dictionary matching
* [ ] Add dark/light theme toggle
* [ ] Create **Flask / Node.js API** version
* [ ] Store evaluation history locally (via IndexedDB)
* [ ] Add **unit tests** for scoring functions
